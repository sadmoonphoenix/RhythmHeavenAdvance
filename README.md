# Building
You'll need a legally obtained ROM of Rhythm Tengoku (Rev 0) (CRC32: 349D7025) for all systems.

### Windows
If you want to be able to edit the audio files on Windows you'll need to have FFmpeg on the root of project or in your PATH (system-wide installation)!
1. Open a command prompt.
2. Download the Rhythm Heaven Advance repository.
	```batch
	git clone https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenAdvance
	cd RhythmHeavenAdvance
	```
	or you could also just download the source directly from GitHub [here](https://github.com/ShaffySwitcher/RhythmHeavenSilver/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (not recommended).
3. Put a Rhythm Tengoku (Rev 0) (CRC32: `349D7025`) ROM named "rh-jpn.gba" at the root of the project.
4. Compile.
	```batch
	compile.bat
	```
	or by simply clicking on "compile.bat" with your mouse.
	
If compiling worked you should have an ROM of Rhythm Heaven Advance into the "build" folder called "rh-eng.gba"!
	
### Dependencies
On Linux & macOS you need to install Perl, Mono and FFmpeg! Git will be included in the commands below, in case your distro doesn't ship it. 

On Linux systems, you can install them from your native package manager if you haven't already:
* Debian/Ubuntu: ```sudo apt install perl mono-runtime ffmpeg git```
* Fedora: ```sudo dnf install perl mono-core ffmpeg-free git```
* Arch: ```sudo pacman -S perl mono ffmpeg git --needed```
* OpenSUSE: ```sudo zypper in perl mono-core ffmpeg git-core```

On macOS systems, you can install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then run the following commands to install what you need:
```brew install perl mono ffmpeg```
